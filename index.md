__Cuento de Invierno__ was an interdisciplinary project realized by students in the Theater, Dance, Music and Visual Arts programs at [Universidad del Atlantico](https://www.uniatlantico.edu.co/uatlantico/) in Barranquilla, Colombia, in 2016-17. Around 80 students, assisted by around 11 faculty, loosely adapted Marcelo Cohen's translation of Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale for the stage. They built sets, wrote music, choreographed, designed lighting and designed posters and lots of other things.

A lot of the physical records that document this experience are in different places. Some photographs and art work, however, have been preserved here.
